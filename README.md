# Test-Canary: Miscellaneous Files for ML + Web Development
This project is a collection of miscellaneous files used for machine learning and web development. It includes a variety of scripts and configuration files that demonstrate different aspects of these fields, such as training a convolutional neural network, creating a simple web page, and performing basic arithmetic operations.

## Installation and Usage
To use this project, you will need Python and PyTorch installed on your machine. You can install the project by cloning the repository and running the scripts in your local environment. For detailed instructions, please refer to the individual files.

## Dependencies
This project requires the following software and libraries:
* Python
* PyTorch

## File Descriptions
* `config.yaml`: This file contains the configuration for the machine learning model, including the model name, number of classes, and training parameters. It is used to set up and customize the model for training.
* `frontend.css`: This file contains the CSS styles for the web page. It defines the look and feel of the web page.
* `train.py`: This file contains the script for training the convolutional neural network. It uses the configuration from `config.yaml` to train the model.
* `calculator.py`: This file contains a simple calculator program. It demonstrates basic arithmetic operations in Python.

## Usage Examples
To run the training script, use the following command:
```
python train.py
```
To use the calculator program, use the following command:
```
python calculator.py
```
