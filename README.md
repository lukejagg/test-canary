# test
This project is a combination of machine learning and web development. It aims to provide a platform for testing PRs in a real-world scenario involving both machine learning models and web development.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, clone the repository to your local machine. Install the necessary dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Set up the project locally by following the instructions in the 'Machine Learning' and 'Web Development' sections.

## Machine Learning
The machine learning part of the project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for training. To train the model, run `python train.py`. The trained model can be used for predictions by running `python predict.py`.

## Web Development
The web development part of the project involves a simple calculator program. To start the server and access the application, run `python server.py` and navigate to `localhost:5000` in your web browser.

## Usage
Examples of how to use the project can be found in the 'examples' directory. This includes screenshots and code snippets demonstrating how to use the machine learning model and the web application.

## Contributing
Contributions to the project are welcome. Please follow the guidelines in the 'CONTRIBUTING.md' file when making a contribution.
