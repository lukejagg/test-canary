## Dependencies
This project requires the following software and libraries:
* Python
* PyTorch

## File Descriptions
* `config.yaml`: This file contains the configuration for the machine learning model, including the model name, number of classes, and training parameters. It is used to set up and customize the model for training. The configuration parameters can be easily modified to suit different machine learning models and training requirements.
* `frontend.css`: This file contains the CSS styles for the web page. It defines the look and feel of the web page. The styles are written in a modular and scalable manner, making it easy to modify and extend.
* `train.py`: This file contains the script for training the convolutional neural network. It uses the configuration from `config.yaml` to train the model. The script includes functions for loading data, building the model, training the model, and saving the trained model.
* `calculator.py`: This file contains a simple calculator program. It demonstrates basic arithmetic operations in Python. The calculator supports operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Usage Examples
To run the training script, use the following command:
```
python train.py
```
To use the calculator program, use the following command:
```
python calculator.py
```

## Known Issues and Limitations
Currently, there are no known issues or limitations. However, please note that the machine learning model used in this project is a basic convolutional neural network and may not provide the best performance for complex datasets. Also, the web page created using the provided CSS styles is a simple page and may not include advanced features like responsiveness or animations. Please report any issues you encounter by creating a new issue on the GitHub repository.
