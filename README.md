# test-canary
This project is a collection of miscellaneous files for machine learning and web development. It includes a machine learning script for training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the CIFAR-10 dataset, a web server setup, and a calculator script.

## Machine Learning
The machine learning part of the project involves training a CNN on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The script for this is `train.py`. To run this script, you will need to have PyTorch installed. You can install it with the following command:

```
pip install torch torchvision
```

Once you have PyTorch installed, you can run the script with the following command:

```
python train.py
```

## Web Development
The web development part of the project involves setting up and running a web server. The server is built using Node.js and Express.js. To set up the development environment, you will need to have Node.js and npm installed. You can install them with the following commands:

```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.38.0/install.sh | bash
nvm install node
```

Once you have Node.js and npm installed, you can install the project dependencies with the following command:

```
npm install
```

To run the web server, use the following command:

```
npm start
```

## Calculator Script
The calculator script (`calculator.py`) is a simple interactive calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations. You can run it with the following command:

```
python calculator.py
```
