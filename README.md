## Exponent Operation

The `exponent` function is a new addition to the calculator. It takes two parameters: `base` and `exponent`. The function returns the result of `base` raised to the power of `exponent`. It also includes error handling to check if the `base` is a negative number and the `exponent` is a fractional number. If this is the case, it raises a ValueError with a suitable error message.
