This project is a collection of miscellaneous files for machine learning and web development. It includes a machine learning script for training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the CIFAR-10 dataset, a web server setup, and a calculator script.

## Machine Learning
The machine learning part of the project involves training a CNN on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The script for this is `train.py`. To run this script, you will need to have PyTorch installed. You can install it with the following command:

```
pip install torch torchvision
```

Once you have PyTorch installed, you can run the script with the following command:

```
python train.py
```

## Web Development
The web development part of the project involves setting up and running a web server. More details on this will be added soon.

## Calculator Script
The calculator script (`calculator.py`) is a simple interactive calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations. You can run it with the following command:

```
python calculator.py
```
